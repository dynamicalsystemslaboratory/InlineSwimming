# Maurizio Porfiri, Mert Karakaya, Raghu Ram Sattanapalle, and Sean D. Peterson

Experimental trajectories and orientations are provided in the experiments folder.
Videos folder contain the simulations for stability configurations (in-line and side-by-side), a simulation with random parameters from the calibrated range of parameters, and video of a pair of zebrafish swimming together.
Calibrated model parameters can be found in the calibration folder.
