# Emergence of in-line swimming patterns in zebrafish pairs
# Maurizio Porfiri, Mert Karakaya, Raghu Ram Sattanapalle, and Sean D. Peterson

Experimental trajectories and orientations are provided in the "Experiments" folder. The "Videos" folder contain simulations without additive noise to illustrate the stability/instability of two schooling patterns (in-line and side-by-side), a simulation with added noise and random parameters chosen from the calibrated range of parameters, and video of a pair of zebrafish swimming together. Calibrated model parameters can be found in the "Calibration" folder.
